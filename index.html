	<!-- <p1> Very cautious when sharing that I am a 25 year old black man from Brooklyn, NY because normally that should follow with a mixtape of some sort, a crime record, or a successful sports story. But here you have a very simple being in front of you, an introvert who speaks loudly as a defense mechanism that is creating a site for you to get an idea of who I am.  -->

	<!-- <p2> It is also difficult to share what my plans are, since they seem to change every 6 months. But for now I am the cheffing, broadcast journalisting, pastoring, orthodontic, software developer, here to season a little more flavor to your front end. Hope it doesn't come out stinky on the back end. Cheers.  -->
